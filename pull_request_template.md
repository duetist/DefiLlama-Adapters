##### Description/bio (to be shown on DefiLlama):Zerogoki: Algorithm Pegged Leveraged Token Minting and Trading Protocol. REI is the main asset in the system and the valuable source of synthetic assets. The user burns REI in Lite Mint and issues zAsset. As more synthetic assets are minted, more REI will be burned, so the total amount of REI will decrease as the type and scale of synthetic assets grows. The initial total amount of REI is determined, and the destruction of zAsset will increase the circulation of REI. Therefore, REI is a value bridge between Zerogoki's synthetic assets and external assets.
